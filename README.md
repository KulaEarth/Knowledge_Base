# Sustainable and Compassionate Living Sanctuary Network

## For belonging and landscape regeneration

### This document outlines the design pathway, based on Permaculture Design Principles, for developing a network of sustainable and compassionate living sanctuaries. These sanctuaries are physical spaces which will act as a place of inspiration for all who are looking to learn and live into their own self-sustainable systems, with nature and with a small ecological footprint.

## Permaculture Ethics and Principles 
from “Permaculture. A Designers’ Manual.” by Bill Mollison.

## The ethical basis of permaculture
- Care for the Earth
- Care for people
- Governance of abundance

<details> <summary> Permaculture Principles </summary>
<summary>	• Work with nature rather than against it– assist rather than impede the natural elements and succession. </summary>
<summary>	• The problem is the solution– it is how we see things that make them advantageous or not. </summary>
<summary>	• Make the least change for the greatest possible effect– emphasis on the placement of design elements where they can assist each other in function and energy recycling. </summary>
<summary>	• The yield of a system is theoretically unlimited– the only limitation is that of the information and imagination of the designer </summary>
<summary>	• Everything gardens– notice patterns of plants and animals and you will find allies in your efforts to sustain yourself and other species </summary>

<summary>Design and Function of the Sanctuary Pathways</summary>

- Interpretive Centre: 
	- The interpretive centre will be designed to improve the understanding and stewardship of local landscapes. 
	- The centre will allow people who are interested in living self-sustainably to live and engage with local communities on regenerative initiatives. Each interpretive centre would be part of the larger network of sanctuaries which will allow people from different regenerative initiatives to share and foster bioregional learning. Elements in the design of the interpretive centre at the sanctuary will include:
- Culture, and natural ecology knowledge bank:
- Art and storytelling residency
- Youth ranger program
- Applied learning workshops: 
	- The interpretive centre will host workshops that will act as the educational/ applied learning pathways for the people from the communities to engage with the sanctuary. 
	- The topics of the workshop will vary depending on the local context the sanctuary is situated in. 
	- The goals of the workshops is to empower individuals with knowledge and skills that will enable them to actively participate in and contribute to the long-term ecological stewardship of their landscapes. 
- Afterschool programs: 
	- new gardening and growing techniques
	- sports 
	- Permaculture design workshops
	- Nature-based wellness 
	- Intergenerational belonging
	- Raw material processing
- Food production system: 
	- The regenerative food production system will be inspired by the patterns of nature and local climates. 
	- Crop calendar will be maintained for each of the sanctuary to ensure the maximum food production throughout the year on the available land. 
	- The varieties of fruits and vegetables chosen to grow will be suitable for the local climate and additional varieties can be trailed for suitability at the microclimate labs as soil improvs and demand emerges.

## Soil Test Guide:
## A permaculture approach to soil:

Throughout the world, modern agricultural practice have had a degrading effect on soil quality. Rather than build up the natural fertility of soil, fertility comes from the addition of mineral and chemical fertilisers. The use of heavy machinery on soil can break down its structure and lead to compaction. In contrast, permaculture seeks to create systems where natural soil fertility is fostered, through the encouragement of worms and other soil fauna and good manual cultivation practices. In these tests and the accompanying advice booklet, we do not seek to favour forest gardening over raised beds, or no till systems over till systems. There is a wide range of literature that can offer advice on this and each grower will have his or her own opinions.
## <a name="_2gd9p7456tlu"></a>Selecting sample locations:
When selecting the place to conduct your test, it is important to pick a sample spot that is typical of the site. There are several important factors to consider: 

•The slope or gradient relative to the rest of the site 

•The drainage of the soil (is it wet and waterlogged or dry?)

•What has the soil been used for (Edible, non-edible etc) 

•Ideally the soil has not recently been disturbed (not recently harvested, tilled etc) 

•The soil should be bare (you can clear away any grass or vegetation just before you do the test) 
### <a name="_j9q550tck764"></a>Equipment needed:
•Empty cylindrical baked bean or fruit tin (about 7cm in diameter), with top and bottom removed 

•Gardening gloves 

•500ml bottle 

•Water 

•Timer (or a watch with a second hand)

•Spade 

•Ruler/Tape measure 

•Plastic sheet (bin liner) 

•Flat-bottomed plastic container (at least 7cm x 7cm) 

•Fine tip marker pen

•Glass Jar (preferably tall and thin) 

•pH paper (very cheap and easily available from pharmacies, high school chemistry labs, agricultural extension agents, or the internet.) 

•pH chart (included in this booklet) 

•flat bladed knife

## <a name="_220hfxlxxvwm"></a>Preliminary tests: 

**Purpose:**

` `To check you are that your test site is not anaerobic, polluted, waterlogged or too dry. 

**1) Anaerobic conditions and pollution** 

**The smell test:** 
w
1\.Take a handful of soil from the site. 

2\.Thoroughly smell the handful of soil, does it have a: 

•Sour, putrid or chemical smell? 

•No smell? 

•Earthy, sweet or fresh smell? 

3\. Record the answer. 

**2) Waterlogging and dryness** 

**The squeeze test:** 

1\.Take a handful of soil in your palm and squeeze

2\.Observe what happens to the soil: 

•The soil is dry if there is no water and the soil does not stick together at all when squeezed.

` `•The soil is moist if there is no visible water and no drips, however the soil sticks together slightly and is not dry

•The soil is wet if there is visible water which runs or drips out of the soil when squeezed 

1\.Record the answer. **If soil smells sour, chemical or putrid, or if it is so damp that water drips from your hand when you squeeze then this is not a viable area to undertake the soils tests. Choose another site. If soil is dry some of the tests won't work. Either water this site thoroughly and try again tomorrow or choose another site.**
## <a name="_n86r1twa78ck"></a>Main Soil tests:
### <a name="_139jwyty9eag"></a>1. Drainage 
**Purpose:** To test how well water drains through your soil. Drainage is important if your soil is not going to get waterlogged in wet weather. Clay soil will drain more slowly than sandy soil. Heavily compacted soil will not drain well. Shallow soil will not drain well. 

**The infiltration test:** Equipment: Empty food tin, gardening gloves, 500ml bottle, water, timer 

1\.Remove the top and bottom of the tin so you are left with a metal tube 

2\.Wearing gloves, firmly push the tin into the soil (a piece of wood and a hammer can help with this in firm soil) until it is half-way in 

3\.Gently use your finger to firm the soil around the edge of the ring, taking care not to disturb the soil in the middle 

4\.Pour 500ml water as gently as possible into the tin 

5\.As soon as you start pouring start the timer 

6\.Stop the timer when the soil surface is glistening rather than submerged 

7\.Record the time this took. (If the water is still present after 15 minutes record that and move on to the next test)  

### <a name="_y9hhq39435wd"></a>**2. Earthworms** 
Please note that the earthworm test may not be suitable for all projects. In some places, for example, termites may have a key role in building soil.

**Purpose:** 

To establish how many earthworms are in your soil. They are a proxy for all biological life in the soil, large and small. Please note depending on the time of year and climate there may be variation in the number of earthworms in the top few inches of your soil. 

**Earthworm count:** 

Equipment: Spade, ruler/tape measure, plastic sheet (bin liner), distilled/rain water, plastic container, sachet of mustard sauce. 

1\.Dig a 20cm x 20cm pit with a depth of 10cm.

2\.Place soil on a flat surface (plastic sheet or bin liner recommended). 

3\.Count the number of earthworms and record.

### <a name="_x72vdst0p10l"></a>3. Top soil depth 
**Purpose:** To measure the depth of your top soil. The deeper the top soil, the further roots can grow and the more water and nutrients will be available. Deep soil will also drain better than shallow soil. 

**The soil depth test:** 

Equipment: Garden spade, ruler/ tape measure 

**Warning: This will be hard work so please let us not overdo it!** 

1\.Dig a hole at least 60cm deep if possible.

2\.If you cannot easily reach this depth make a note in the records section 

3\.Make a note of the top soil depth. Only measure the top soil; sub soil will be much more compact and probably a different colour. Record which of the following bands it falls into:

•very shallow (<15 cm) •shallow (15-30 cm) 

•moderately deep (30-60 cm) 

•deep (>60 cm) 

1\.Record your results.









### <a name="_jfsd5f4hxyon"></a>4. Soil texture 
**Purpose:** To establish the proportion of clay, silt and sand in your soil. Clay soil will hold water and nutrients but is easily compacted and can become waterlogged in wet weather and bake hard in dry weather. Sandy soil holds its structure well but drains quickly and does not hold nutrients well. Silty soils comes in the middle. Loam is a good mix of clay, silt and sand. 

**The soil jar test:** 

Equipment: Glass jar, timer, water, ruler/tape measure and a fine-tip marker pen 

1\.Remove a vertical slice of soil approximately 30 cm deep from the side of the pit being used for soil tests. 

2\.Remove any large rocks or organic matter, then break up all the lumps. 

3\.Fill the jar to the halfway point with soil 

4\.Using your fingers forcefully pack the soil down as much as possible to reduce pore space and mark the level of soil on the side of the jar with a pen. 

5\.Fill the jar to the ¾ mark with water and shake vigorously for 3 minutes or until the sample is fully suspended in the water. 

6\.Set down the jar on a level surface where it can be left undisturbed for at least a day and start the timer. 7.After 1 minute mark on the side of the jar the level of settled particles at the bottom, this is the volume of sand in the sample.

8\.After 2 hours mark on the side of the jar the level of settled particles, these particles are the silt in the sample.

9\.After the water has cleared (this can take over 24 hours) mark on the side of the jar the level of particles. These particles are the clay in the sample. 

10\. Using a ruler or a tape measure use the distances on the jar to calculate the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay in the soil samples. 

11\. Using the soil texture triangle below determine the type of soil 12. Record your results.
### <a name="_tcd2jysg6rb5"></a>5. Soil structure 
**Purpose:** To find the physical structure of your soil. The visual inspection test 

Equipment: Garden spade, bin bag or plastic sheet 

1\.Take a vertical soil slice of approximately 30 cm from the side of the test pit. 

2\.Carefully lay the slice on its side, preferably on a piece of plastic such as a bin liner to make visibility easier. 

3\.Now choose which of the following descriptions best fits the sample: 

•Soft: The soil is crumbly and breaks up easily 

•Cloddy: The soil breaks into lumps (clods) that are difficult to break down 

•Platey: The soil breaks into flat plates that are difficult to break down. 

1\.Record the result.

2\.Inspect the soil for any bands of discolouration or hard, compact soil running horizontally. This may indicate a layer of compaction known as a pan that will prevent water, nutrients and plant roots penetrating deeply into your soil. 

3\.Record the result. 

**The slaking and dispersal test:** 

Equipment: Flat bottomed plastic container, water, teaspoon 

1\.From the visual inspection sample select three pea-sized lumps of soil. 

2\.Fill the container with rainwater and place it on a flat, stable surface. 

3\.Use the teaspoon to place the lumps in the water, equally spread apart.

4\.After 2 hours record the degree to which slaking (when the small lumps have broken down into smaller particles as a result of being immersed in water) has taken place: 

•Completely (indicated when the base of the container is covered with a layer of clay and there is only a pile of sand where the aggregates were) 

•Partially (indicated when a milky 'halo' has developed round lumps) 

•Not at all 1.After 24 hours record whether dispersal is complete or partial. 

2\.Record your results.
### <a name="_qiuwe8dtcob5"></a>6. Soil pH
pH testing paper (litmus paper) is very cheap and is easily available from pharmacies, high school chemistry labs, agricultural extension agents, or the internet. 

Purpose: To establish the acidity or alkalinity of your soil. PH can range from 1 (very acid) though 7 (neutral) to 14 (very alkali). Most plants need a pH between 6 and 7.5 to grow well, although a small number are suited to a pH outside this range. 

**The pH test:** 

Equipment: pH paper and chart, cup, water

1\.Fill a cup 2/3 full with soil. 

2\.Add just enough water to cover the soil sample. 

3\.Stir the contents for approximately one minute. 

4\.Completely immerse the pH strip in the soil solution for 3 seconds 

5\.Remove the strip and quickly rinse with water (the water must be from the same source as was used in the solution) 

6\.Hold the pH paper up to the light and compare the colour to the attached colour table to identify the pH of the soil. 

7\.Record your result.

### <a name="_jjhhj1veb4da"></a>**7. Soil Compaction** 
Although one of the most useful tests, this is also the most complex so you may wish to skip it if you are short of time. Purpose: To see how compacted your soil is. Roots and shoots will find it hard to grow through compacted soil. They much prefer loose, crumbly soil. 

**The bulk density test:** 

Equipment: Garden trowel, flat bladed knife, sealable bags, marker pen, scales, tin, ruler 
1\.Remove the top and bottom of the tin so you are left with a metal tube 

2\.Measure the diameter of the tin, then half it to give the radius 

3\.Firmly push the tin into the soil (a piece of wood and hammer can help with this in firm soil) until it is at least 2/3 of the way in 

4\.The exact depth that the tin has gone into the soil must be determined, so using the ruler measure the height from the top of the tin to the soil surface four times evenly spaced and record the average, subtract this from the total height of the tin to get the depth the tin has gone into the soil 

5\.Using the trowel carefully dig around the tin to remove it, it is very important not to disturb the soil in the bottom of the tube 

6\.Remove excess soil from the bottom of the tube with the flat bladed knife, the soil surface should be flat and level with the end of the tin 

7\.Place the entire soil sample in a plastic bag and label to take home 

8\.The soil must be completely dry before bulk density can be calculated so depending on the climate either allow soil to dry in a warm place over night with the bag open or place in an oven on a low heat. 9.Weigh the dried soil and record the weight 

10\. Calculate the bulk density of your sample using the following equation: 

Bulk density = Mass of soil (g) / Volume of soil (cm3 ) 

Mass of soil = Dry weight of soil 

Volume of soil = Depth of soil in tin (step 4) \* radius of tin (step 2) \* radius of tin \* 3.14 

Record the bulk density.




# <a name="_alwg8kjfiiax"></a>Compost Brewery:
## <a name="_o09k6c2caw2z"></a>A permaculture approach to compost: Permaculturists everywhere are crazy about their compost teas and extracts. They have turned building compost tea brewers into a science and concocting the perfect tea recipe into an art. We love our compost brews too, and since we’re always getting questions about the compost tea process, we thought it was time to sit down and write a post about it. In this article we’ll explain the difference between a tea and an extract, discuss the best ingredients and recipes, and give you the step-by-step how-to for making your own compost tea brewer.
## <a name="_fvfsnea5hvx0"></a>Get to Know Your Brews: Tea vs. Extract![](Aspose.Words.053e3bdf-3ef2-4a77-b552-4e0702e6f0ae.002.jpeg)
What is compost tea? It’s a liquid made by both cold-brewing and aerating compost (or worm castings) in water, in order to extract beneficial organisms (i.e. bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes). During the brewing process, these organisms are “fed” nutrients to rapidly increase their numbers and activity levels (source: [www.vintagerosery.com](https://www.vintagerosery.com/composttea.htm)). It is then applied much like a fertilizer to soil, or to the roots or leaves of a plant. The process can take several days, and brewing itself has to occur over 24 hours.

A compost extract is different for a few reasons:

- Instead of feeding the micro-organisms, the goal is simply to extract the microbes off of the compost or worm castings using the same aeration process.
- Since no additional foods are fed to the organisms, no additional microbes are bred, and an extract can be made in 2 to 4 hours.
- A tea has a shelf life of only 3-4 hours, whereas some experts claim an extract can last up to 2 weeks before things start to go off. (Teas have such a short shelf life because during the 24 hour brewing (feeding and oxygenating) process you have essentially bred more microbes per cc of liquid than would ever occur in nature. So, if you stop the aerator, the enormous number of microbes will consume all of the available oxygen and the liquid will go anaerobic. One of the easiest ways to tell if you have an anaerobic batch is by smell. If it smells bad, it probably is bad.)

## <a name="_nnpu70gk6l9b"></a>Building a Brewer:
### <a name="_gu4dea6s09z7"></a>Costs and Materials:
In total the brewer will have cost about $130 however I think you could build something of equivalent value for about $80 by shopping around on online. The main reason it costs so much was the high pressure, high volume pump. This is important as it aerates and stirs the extract or tea, which ensures that there are no dead spots (anaerobic) in the mixture.

### <a name="_pafqxy2cf285"></a>Recipes: 
(they taste terrible but your plants will love ’em)
#### <a name="_ucofqys20l5m"></a>5 Gallon Extract
To make a 5 gallon extract, fill your bucket 4 inches from the top and bubble air into the water for a few minutes to offgas any chemicals. You will preferably be using clean rain water, filtered city water (no chlorine), or river water. If you don’t have filtered water you can offgas the chlorine by letting your bucket sit out overnight as long as your town or city does not use [chloramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramine). After you have bubbled your water for a few minutes, add 250-500 grams of compost or worm castings into the bucket and let it bubble for 2 – 4 hours. Your extract is now complete and ready to apply.

![](Aspose.Words.053e3bdf-3ef2-4a77-b552-4e0702e6f0ae.004.jpeg)
#### <a name="_wory00q3018g"></a>5 Gallon Tea
The compost tea is more complicated and requires a more thorough process, so we got permission from the Soil Foodweb Canada to post their recipe and procedure [here](https://cdn.permaculturenews.org/files/Main_Compost_Tea_procedures.pdf) (PDF).
### <a name="_1g7ne2tbz0jp"></a>Recommended Doses: How and When to Apply
#### <a name="_said3klkga79"></a>Filtering
Because we have brewed the tea without a tea bag, I would recommend that you filter the tea through nylon or equivalent. If you would rather skip this step you can get commercial tea bags from [www.earthfort.com](https://www.earthfort.com/). We do have some of these tea bags and I am going to try brewing tea/extract with and without them and look at both under the microscope to see which method gives a better product.
#### <a name="_pqj31q91jes0"></a>Dilution
For the 5 gallon brewer, you can dilute with water at any ratio between 2:1 to 4:1. For commercial applications, the recommended dosage is determined by the farmer’s goals and the condition of the soil. Obviously the worse the soil, the higher the concentration needed. Generally speaking though, 1000 litres of tea can spray between 2–5 acres of land. To put that in perspective, my 20 ft x 20ft back yard would only need anywhere from 2–4.4 litres for the entire yard, depending on the application rate. That is a little less than 25% of one 5 gallon brew. The best thing about teas and extracts: as long as they are not anaerobic, you can’t overdo it!![](Aspose.Words.053e3bdf-3ef2-4a77-b552-4e0702e6f0ae.005.jpeg)
#### <a name="_ib2ns2nw5k1n"></a>Watering Can
This is, of course, the easiest way to distribute brews at a home scale. Because they pour out a lot of water at a time, you may want to increase the dilution rate to make sure you cover your desired area. I still recommend filtering your tea/extract first to prevent frustration.
#### <a name="_3bzk02vtz7lc"></a>Hand Spray Equipment![](Aspose.Words.053e3bdf-3ef2-4a77-b552-4e0702e6f0ae.006.jpeg)
The spray is great for foliar and soil drenching. We use a hand sprayer at the Verge Headquarters because we don’t have much area to cover.
#### <a name="_1xpe5pck1wa"></a>Cleaning
We cannot stress enough: you must clean your brewer before and after every brew! Our highly recommended tools: a bristle brush, some concentrated hydrogen peroxide, and warm water. As soon as you empty the tea or extract from the bucket, be sure to take everything apart and scrub it individually. If you don’t, a biofilm will form, which can wreak havoc in future teas and extracts.
